# World Cup 2026 DataViz Dashboard

This project aims to build a complete and interactive dashboard in **Power BI** to track the 2026 FIFA World Cup — from team qualifications to match and player statistics.

## Goals

- Visualize the progress of World Cup 2026 qualifications
- Explore team and player statistics across countries and continents

- Python (for data extraction and transformation)
- Public APIs (RestCountries, Wikipedia, FIFA data)
- CSV files (for custom datasets and quick iterations)
